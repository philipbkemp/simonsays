# S.I.M.O.N. Says

Welcome to **S.I.M.O.N. Says**, a fun and challenging memory game that will test your ability to remember and replicate patterns! The game features a 2x2 grid of lights that will illuminate in a sequence to create a 4-light "message." Your task is to watch carefully, memorise the sequence, and then repeat it. You have three attempts to get it right before moving on to the next pattern.

As you progress through the levels, the game gets more challenging. You'll encounter additional lights, larger grids, and faster sequences to keep you on your toes and sharpening your memory skills.

Are you ready to take on the challenge and see how far you can go?
